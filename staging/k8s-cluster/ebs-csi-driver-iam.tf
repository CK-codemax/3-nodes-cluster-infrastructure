# EBS CSI Driver IAM
# Note: For self-managed clusters, we use instance profiles instead of IRSA/OIDC
# The AWS-managed EBS CSI Driver Policy is attached to the combined AWS workloads instance profile
# This file is kept for reference/outputs but the actual IAM role is not used with instance profiles
